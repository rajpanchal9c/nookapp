## 💪 Daily Motivation

**Remember why you built this:**
- You solve a real problem
- People need better tools for thinking clearly
- You can change lives with Nook

**Daily mantra:**
"I'm building in public. Progress over perfection. Ship daily."

---

## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

**Feeling overwhelmed?**
- Pick the top 3 items for today and focus only on those
- 80% done and shipped beats 100% perfect and delayed

**Procrastinating?**
- Set a 25-min timer and just start on one item
- Momentum builds momentum

**Losing motivation?**
- Remember: someone out there needs what you built
- Every small action compounds over time
- You're further than you were yesterday

---

**Let's go! Start tomorrow. Day 1. Build in public. Ship daily. 🚀**
